Verilog mini projects
Creating a mini project in Verilog for prime number generation using a clock signal involves designing a digital system that can identify prime numbers. Below is an outline of the project description and a high-level approach to implementing it.

Project Description
Title: Prime Number Generation with Clock

Objective: Design a digital system using Verilog that generates prime numbers and outputs them in sequence, synchronized with a clock signal.
